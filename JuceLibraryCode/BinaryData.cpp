"KISS FFT - A mixed-radix Fast Fourier Transform based up on the principle, \n"
"\"Keep It Simple, Stupid.\"\n"
"\n"
"    There are many great fft libraries already around.  Kiss FFT is not trying\n"
"to be better than any of them.  It only attempts to be a reasonably efficient, \n"
"moderately useful FFT that can use fixed or floating data types and can be \n"
"incorporated into someone's C program in a few minutes with trivial licensing.\n"
"\n"
"USAGE:\n"
"\n"
"    The basic usage for 1-d complex FFT is:\n"
"\n"
"        #include \"kiss_fft.h\"\n"
"\n"
"        kiss_fft_cfg cfg = kiss_fft_alloc( nfft ,is_inverse_fft ,0,0 );\n"
"\n"
"        while ...\n"
"        \n"
"            ... // put kth sample in cx_in[k].r and cx_in[k].i\n"
"            \n"
"            kiss_fft( cfg , cx_in , cx_out );\n"
"            \n"
"            ... // transformed. DC is in cx_out[0].r and cx_out[0].i \n"
"            \n"
"        free(cfg);\n"
"\n"
"    Note: frequency-domain data is stored from dc up to 2pi.\n"
"    so cx_out[0] is the dc bin of the FFT\n"
"    and cx_out[nfft/2] is the Nyquist bin (if exists)\n"
"\n"
"    Declarations are in \"kiss_fft.h\", along with a brief description of the \n"
"functions you'll need to use. \n"
"\n"
"Code definitions for 1d complex FFTs are in kiss_fft.c.\n"
"\n"
"You can do other cool stuff with the extras you'll find in tools/\n"
"\n"
"    * multi-dimensional FFTs \n"
"    * real-optimized FFTs  (returns the positive half-spectrum: (nfft/2+1) complex frequency bins)\n"
"    * fast convolution FIR filtering (not available for fixed point)\n"
"    * spectrum image creation\n"
"\n"
"The core fft and most tools/ code can be compiled to use float, double,\n"
" Q15 short or Q31 samples. The default is float.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"BACKGROUND:\n"
"\n"
"    I started coding this because I couldn't find a fixed point FFT that didn't \n"
"use assembly code.  I started with floating point numbers so I could get the \n"
"theory straight before working on fixed point issues.  In the end, I had a \n"
"little bit of code that could be recompiled easily to do ffts with short, float\n"
"or double (other types should be easy too).  \n"
"\n"
"    Once I got my FFT working, I was curious about the speed compared to\n"
"a well respected and highly optimized fft library.  I don't want to criticize \n"
"this great library, so let's call it FFT_BRANDX.\n"
"During this process, I learned:\n"
"\n"
"    1. FFT_BRANDX has more than 100K lines of code. The core of kiss_fft is about 500 lines (cpx 1-d).\n"
"    2. It took me an embarrassingly long time to get FFT_BRANDX working.\n"
"    3. A simple program using FFT_BRANDX is 522KB. A similar program using kiss_fft is 18KB (without optimizing for size).\n"
"    4. FFT_BRANDX is roughly twice as fast as KISS FFT in default mode.\n"
"\n"
"    It is wonderful that free, highly optimized libraries like FFT_BRANDX exist.\n"
"But such libraries carry a huge burden of complexity necessary to extract every \n"
"last bit of performance.\n"
"\n"
"    Sometimes simpler is better, even if it's not better.\n"
"\n"
"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n"
"\tQ: Can I use kissfft in a project with a ___ license?\n"
"\tA: Yes.  See LICENSE below.\n"
"\n"
"\tQ: Why don't I get the output I expect?\n"
"\tA: The two most common causes of this are \n"
"\t\t1) scaling : is there a constant multiplier between what you got and what you want?\n"
"\t\t2) mixed build environment -- all code must be compiled with same preprocessor \n"
"\t\tdefinitions for FIXED_POINT and kiss_fft_scalar\n"
"\n"
"\tQ: Will you write/debug my code for me?\n"
"\tA: Probably not unless you pay me.  I am happy to answer pointed and topical questions, but \n"
"\tI may refer you to a book, a forum, or some other resource.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"PERFORMANCE:\n"
"    (on Athlon XP 2100+, with gcc 2.96, float data type)\n"
"\n"
"    Kiss performed 10000 1024-pt cpx ffts in .63 s of cpu time.\n"
"    For comparison, it took md5sum twice as long to process the same amount of data.\n"
"\n"
"    Transforming 5 minutes of CD quality audio takes less than a second (nfft=1024). \n"
"\n"
"DO NOT:\n"
"    ... use Kiss if you need the Fastest Fourier Transform in the World\n"
"    ... ask me to add features that will bloat the code\n"
"\n"
"UNDER THE HOOD:\n"
"\n"
"    Kiss FFT uses a time decimation, mixed-radix, out-of-place FFT. If you give it an input buffer  \n"
"    and output buffer that are the same, a temporary buffer will be created to hold the data.\n"
"\n"
"    No static data is used.  The core routines of kiss_fft are thread-safe (but not all of the tools directory).\n"
"\n"
"    No scaling is done for the floating point version (for speed).  \n"
"    Scaling is done both ways for the fixed-point version (for overflow prevention).\n"
"\n"
"    Optimized butterflies are used for factors 2,3,4, and 5. \n"
"\n"
"    The real (i.e. not complex) optimization code only works for even length ffts.  It does two half-length\n"
"    FFTs in parallel (packed into real&imag), and then combines them via twiddling.  The result is \n"
"    nfft/2+1 complex frequency bins from DC to Nyquist.  If you don't know what this means, search the web.\n"
"\n"
"    The fast convolution filtering uses the overlap-scrap method, slightly \n"
"    modified to put the scrap at the tail.\n"
"\n"
"LICENSE:\n"
"    Revised BSD License, see COPYING for verbiage. \n"
"    Basically, \"free to use&change, give credit where due, no guarantees\"\n"
"    Note this license is compatible with GPL at one end of the spectrum and closed, commercial software at \n"
"    the other end.  See http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses\n"
"\n"
"    A commercial license is available which removes the requirement for attribution.  Contact me for details.\n"
"\n"
"  \n"
"TODO:\n"
"    *) Add real optimization for odd length FFTs \n"
"    *) Document/revisit the input/output fft scaling\n"
"    *) Make doc describing the overlap (tail) scrap fast convolution filtering in kiss_fastfir.c\n"
"    *) Test all the ./tools/ code with fixed point (kiss_fastfir.c doesn't work, maybe others)\n"
